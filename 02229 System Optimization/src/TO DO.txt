
// QUESTIONS FOR TA:
- Polling Tasks have uneven periods (does not divide 12000), is it okay to still have hyperperiod at 12000?

- How should we combine the WCRT of the EDF-algorithm from the individual polling tasks. Just take the average? Weight them out from how many tasks they each have?


// CHECK:

- Make sure that the initial parameters in Simulated Annealing, testPartitions and findOptimalPartitions are equal

- Let eventWCRT also use weights, like the finalWCRT function does

- findOptimalPartitions & testPartitions still use total instead of avg

- Find best intial parameters for individual polling servers


// IMPLEMENT:

- Support seperation of event tasks (Maybe do that when we find optimal paritions, so only pick solutions that satisfy the seperation requirements?)

- Make function to run ALL datasets and easily see which ones fail

- Make function to test performance of the whole software solution/algorithm

- Make print statements for troubleshooting, e.g. so we quickly can locate a bug and fix during performance testing
