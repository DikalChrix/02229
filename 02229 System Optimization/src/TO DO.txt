
// QUESTIONS FOR TA:

- Polling Tasks have uneven periods (does not divide 12000), is it okay to still have hyperperiod at 12000?

- How should we combine the WCRT of the EDF-algorithm from the individual polling tasks. Just take the average? Weight them out from how many tasks they each have?

- Minimal parameters of EDP-algorithm. If you just let it run, it might reach (1,2,2). Is that okay?

// CHECK:

- Make sure that the initial parameters in Simulated Annealing, testPartitions and findOptimalPartitions are equal

- Let eventWCRT also use weights, like the finalWCRT function does (Double check that it is correct, but is not used after all)

- findOptimalPartitions & testPartitions still use total instead of avg (Kinda need answer from TA on the second question)

- Find best initial parameters for individual polling servers


// IMPLEMENT:

- Support separation of event tasks (Maybe do that when we find optimal partitions, so only pick solutions that satisfy the separation requirements?)

- Make function to run ALL datasets and easily see which ones fail

- Make function to test performance of the whole software solution/algorithm

- Make print statements for troubleshooting, e.g. so we quickly can locate a bug and fix during performance testing

// REMEMBER:

- Additional constraint added to simulated annealing: Polling server budget *number of polling servers =< polling server deadline 

- Another constraint added to simulated annealing: Sum of polling severs budget + max time needed for time tasks each 1000 tics =< Deadline of polling server.
