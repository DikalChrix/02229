Constraint programming:
First install google OR-tools by using pip in the command line using this:
	python -m pip install --upgrade --user ortools

Make sure that the CPdataHandler.py and CPscheduler.py is in the same folder.

To run the constrain programming approach, run CPscheduler.py with python.

For selecting a specific taskset, open the CPscheduler.py file and edit the filepath variable
to the filepath of the taskset to be run.
